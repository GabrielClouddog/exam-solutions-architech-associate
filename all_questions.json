        "explanation": "Let's analyse this:\n\nB. On a Snowball Edge device you can copy files with a speed of up to 100Gbps. 70TB will take around 5600 seconds, so very quickly, less than 2 hours. The downside is that it'll take between 4-6 working days to receive the device and then another 2-3 working days to send it back and for AWS to move the data onto S3 once it reaches them. Total time: 6-9 working days. Bandwidth used: 0.\n\nC. File Gateway uses the Internet, so maximum speed will be at most 1Gbps, so it'll take a minimum of 6.5 days and you use 70TB of Internet bandwidth.\n\nD. You can achieve speeds of up to 10Gbps with Direct Connect. Total time 15.5 hours and you will use 70TB of bandwidth. However, what's interesting is that the question does not specific what type of bandwidth? Direct Connect does not use your Internet bandwidth, as you will have a dedicate peer to peer connectivity between your on-prem and the AWS Cloud, so technically, you're not using your \"public\" bandwidth. \n\nThe requirements are a bit too vague but I think that B is the most appropriate answer, although D might also be correct if the bandwidth usage refers strictly to your public connectivity.",

CloudFront improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos) and dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery). Global Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP by proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.

The company wants to implement an AWS service to handle messages between the two applications. The sender application can send about 1,000 messages each hour. The messages may take up to 2 days to be processed: If the messages fail to process, they must be retained so that they do not impact the processing of any remaining messages.\n\nWhich solution meets these requirements and is the MOST operationally efficient?",

The pilot light approach requires you to “turn on” servers, possibly deploy additional (non-core) infrastructure, and scale up, whereas warm standby only requires you to scale up (everything is already deployed and running).

It already has scheduled scaling that works well in this scenario. Scale down after working hours and scale up in working hours. So, it just needs to adjust the desired number to start from 20 instances.\n\nBut here is the point it shows A is WRONG!!!\nIf it started with desired 20 instances, it will keep it for the whole day.

When you use the payment ID as the partition key, all messages for that payment ID will be sent to the same shard, ensuring that the order of messages is maintained.\n\nOn the other hand, Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. While it can store data with partition keys, it does not guarantee the order of records within a partition, which is essential for the given use case. Hence, using Kinesis Data Streams is more suitable for this requirement.\n\nAs DynamoDB does not keep the order, I think BE is the correct answer here.",

        "explanation": "Using EC2 hibernation and Auto Scaling warm pools will help address this:\n\nHibernation saves the in-memory state of the EC2 instance to persistent storage and shuts the instance down. When the instance is started again, the in-memory state is restored, which launches much faster than launching a new instance.\nWarm pools pre-initialize EC2 instances and keep them ready to fulfill requests, reducing launch time. The hibernated instances can be added to a warm pool.\nWhen auto scaling scales out during the next testing phase, it will be able to launch instances from the warm pool rapidly since they are already initialized",

Amazon S3 doesn't support this transition within the first 30 days because newer objects are often accessed more frequently or deleted sooner than is suitable for S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA storage.\n\nSimilarly, if you are transitioning noncurrent objects (in versioned buckets), you can transition only objects that are at least 30 days noncurrent to S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA storage.\n\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html",

Amazon S3 supports both gateway endpoints and interface endpoints. With a gateway endpoint, you can access Amazon S3 from your VPC, without requiring an internet gateway or NAT device for your VPC, and with no additional cost. However, gateway endpoints do not allow access from on-premises networks, from peered VPCs in other AWS Regions, or through a transit gateway. For those scenarios, you must use an interface endpoint, which is available for an additional cost.

DB cluster usage increases at a much faster rate.\n\nThe company adds a read replica, which reduces the DB cluster usage for a short period of time. However, the load continues to increase. The operations that cause the increase in DB cluster usage are all repeated read statements that are related to delivery details.

Instead, they are directed to a centralized mailbox, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information. Additionally, configuring alternate contacts for each account using a single business-managed email distribution list for the billing team, the security team, and the operations team ensures that notifications are appropriately routed to the respective teams based on the categories of billing, operations, or security.

        "question": "A company runs its legacy web application on AWS. The web application server runs on an Amazon EC2 instance in the public subnet of a VPC. The web application server collects images from customers and stores the image files in a locally attached Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. The image files are uploaded every night to an Amazon S3 bucket for backup.\n\nA solutions architect discovers that the image files are being uploaded to Amazon S3 through the public endpoint.

        "explanation": "A - On-premises Active Directory already exists.\nB - \"Manually\" ? Oh hell no. But MFA is something I guess.\nC - AD Connector seamlessly connects AWS to the on-premises Active Directory without the need to synchronize or replicate the directory. Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO) allows centralized access management across AWS accounts in an AWS Organizations setup. Permissions sets can be configured to map Active Directory groups to specific AWS accounts and resources, making access control easy and secure.\nD - Amazon Cognito is better suited for application-level identity management (like customer-facing apps), not for internal teams working across multiple AWS accounts.",
